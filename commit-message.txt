fix: Resolve "Maximum update depth exceeded" error in pattern examples page

This commit fixes the infinite render loop in the pattern examples page by:

1. Optimizing component state management in PatternQuestion.tsx:
   - Added deep comparison before updating local state
   - Used React.useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Fixed duplicate IDs in RadioGroupItem elements

2. Improving state handling in pattern-examples/page.tsx:
   - Optimized state updates using React.useCallback
   - Added memoization for pattern descriptions
   - Fixed pattern tabs content rendering
   - Added proper type checking in state updates

These changes resolve the issue where the RadioGroup components were causing
an infinite loop of state updates when users interacted with the pattern examples page.
