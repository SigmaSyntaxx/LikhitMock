Navigating the roads of Nepal requires a solid understanding of its traffic rules. This guide provides an overview of key regulations to help you drive safely and legally.

### General Rules of the Road

*   **Keep Left:** In Nepal, traffic keeps to the left side of the road.
*   **Overtaking:** Overtake from the right, ensuring the way is clear. Do not overtake on bends, junctions, or when visibility is poor.
*   **Speed Limits:** Adhere to posted speed limits. General limits may apply in areas without specific signage (e.g., 40 km/h in urban areas, 80 km/h on highways, but always check local signs).
*   **Seatbelts:** Compulsory for drivers and front-seat passengers in cars.
*   **Helmets:** Compulsory for both rider and pillion passenger on motorcycles and scooters.

### Traffic Signals

*   **Red Light:** Stop before the stop line. Do not proceed until the light turns green.
*   **Yellow (Amber) Light:** Prepare to stop. If you are too close to stop safely when it appears, you may proceed with caution.
*   **Green Light:** Proceed if the way is clear.

### Priority at Junctions

*   **Roundabouts:** Give way to traffic approaching from your right already in the roundabout.
*   **Uncontrolled Junctions:** Give way to traffic on the major road, or if roads are of equal importance, typically to traffic from your right (local practices can vary, be cautious).
*   **Pedestrian Crossings:** Give way to pedestrians on or about to step onto a pedestrian crossing.

### Parking Regulations

*   Do not park where 'No Parking' signs are displayed.
*   Avoid parking on bends, near junctions, on bridges, or where your vehicle may obstruct traffic or pedestrians.
*   Park on the left side of the road, in the direction of traffic flow.

### Documents to Carry

*   Valid Driving License
*   Vehicle Registration Certificate (Blue Book)
*   Vehicle Tax Receipt (paid up to date)
*   Third-Party Insurance Certificate

### Prohibitions

*   **Driving under the influence (DUI):** Strictly prohibited. Zero tolerance for alcohol.
*   **Using mobile phones:** Not allowed while driving, unless using a hands-free system.
*   **Overloading:** Do not exceed the vehicle's permitted carrying capacity for passengers or goods.

This is not an exhaustive list. Always refer to official publications from the Department of Transport Management (DoTM) for the most current and complete information. Drive defensively and prioritize safety.
