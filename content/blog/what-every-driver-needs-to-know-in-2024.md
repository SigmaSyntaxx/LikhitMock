# üöó Nepal‚Äôs New Driving License Test Rules: What Every Driver Needs to Know in 2024

If you‚Äôre planning to take your driving license test in Nepal, there‚Äôs important news you should be aware of. The *Department of Transport Management (DoTM)* has officially updated the driving test rules, making the system more detailed and safety-focused. Whether you're riding a two-wheeler or a four-wheeler, passing the test now requires sharper skills and greater awareness.

Let‚Äôs break down the latest rules and what they mean for you.

---

## üì¢ What‚Äôs Changed?

To pass the driving license test, *you now need at least 70 out of 100 marks* in both the *written* and *practical* exams.

The revised system introduces a *graded error structure*, meaning not all mistakes are equal‚Äîsome will cost you points, while others might lead to an immediate fail. This change aims to create a fairer, more realistic testing environment that emphasizes safe driving behavior.

---

## üõµ For Two-Wheeler Riders (Motorbikes & Scooters)

Here‚Äôs how the practical test is now evaluated:

### 1. Figure 8 (20 Points)
- Touching the boundary or stepping inside once: *-5 points*
- Multiple touches, incorrect entry, or engine turning off: *Immediate fail*

### 2. Narrow Plank (10 Points)
- Stepping on the ground or going off the plank: *Immediate fail*

### 3. U-Turn (10 Points)
- Not using indicators: *Lose all 10 points*
- Touching the boundary: *Fail*

### 4. Traffic Lights (15 Points)
- Ignoring signal rules: *Lose all points*

### 5. Speedbreakers (15 Points)
- One-time ground touch or engine off: *-5 points*
- Repeated mistakes: *Fail*

### 6. Ramp (20 Points)
- Crossing the line incorrectly, stopping over the line, or sliding back more than 6 inches: *Fail*

### 7. Behavioral Checks (10 Points)
- Not checking mirrors, brakes, tires, or riding recklessly: *Points deducted*

## üöô For Four-Wheeler Drivers

While the scoring concept is similar, the structure of the test and course may vary slightly depending on vehicle size and handling. Core focus areas still include:

- *Ramp performance*
- *Reverse parking*
- *Lane discipline*
- *Traffic light obedience*
- *Use of indicators and mirrors*
- *Smooth control at speed bumps and turns*

---

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- *Accuracy Matters*: Precision on the test course is crucial  
- *Safety First*: The new system emphasizes real-world safe driving habits  
- *Understand the Mistakes*: Some errors cost you a few points, others end your test‚Äîknow the difference  
- *Behavior Counts*: Reckless or careless actions, even off the course, can hurt your score  

---

## üß† Pro Tip: Prepare Smart

- Practice the *Figure 8* and *Ramp* sections thoroughly‚Äîthey carry the most weight and highest risk of failure  
- Visit a nearby test track to get comfortable with the layout  
- Stay calm, focused, and confident on test day  
- Always check the [DoTM website](https://www.dotm.gov.np) for updates before applying or testing

## Final Word

The updated test rules might seem stricter, but they‚Äôre designed to make you a better, more responsible driver. Approach your preparation with focus and determination. With enough practice and a cool head, passing your driving license test in Nepal is totally within reach.

*Drive safe‚Äîand good luck on your journey to the open road!* üõ£Ô∏è
